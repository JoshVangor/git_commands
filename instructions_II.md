**Git** is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in source code during software development, allowing multiple developers to collaborate, manage different versions, and merge their work seamlessly. It enables efficient code management, fosters collaboration, and ensures the integrity and history of a project's development.

**GitHub** is a web-based platform for version control using Git, enabling collaboration among software developers by allowing them to host, review, and manage code repositories. It provides tools for tracking changes, managing issues, and facilitating contributions through pull requests.
